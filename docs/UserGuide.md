## Quick start

### Prerequisites

1. **Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your Computer.**
   
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Java Installation Guide:**
   
   **Windows users:** Download Java 17 from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17).
   
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
   
   **Linux users:** Install OpenJDK 17 using your package manager:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk`
   - CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install java-17-openjdk-devel`
   - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S jdk17-openjdk`
   </div>

2. **Verify Java Installation:**
   Open a command terminal as follows:
   - On Windows, press the Windows key on your keyboard, and type in cmd
   - On Mac, press the Command + Space keys at the same time, and type in terminal
   - On Linux, press the Control + Alt + T keys at the same time.

   Then in your terminal, run:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   openjdk version "17.0.x" 2023-xx-xx
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.x+x)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.x+x, mixed mode, sharing)

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/PERSON_NAME`, `PERSON_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Alice Tan`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/PERSON_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Alice Tan t/vipHandler` or as `n/Alice Tan`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG​]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/vipHandler`, `t/vipHandler t/teamLead` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Data Management

### Saving the data

FirstImpressions data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

FirstImpressions data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FirstImpressions will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the FirstImpressions to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FirstImpressions home folder (your `addressbook.json` file from the `data` folder).

**Q**: Can I use FirstImpressions without an internet connection?<br>
**A**: Yes, FirstImpressions is a desktop application that works completely offline. All your data is stored locally on your computer.

**Q**: What happens if I accidentally delete a person?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, there is no built-in undo feature. However, you can restore your data by copying a backup of your `addressbook.json` file from the `data` folder.

**Q**: Can I import contacts from other applications?<br>
**A**: Currently, FirstImpressions does not support direct import from other applications. You would need to manually add contacts using the `add` command.

**Q**: Is there a limit to the number of contacts I can store?<br>
**A**: There is no hard limit, but performance may decrease with very large datasets (thousands of contacts). The application is optimized for typical business use cases.

**Q**: Can I customize the date and time format?<br>
**A**: No, the application uses a fixed format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` for dates and times. This ensures consistency across all users.

**Q**: What if I forget the exact name of a person when using delete or edit commands?<br>
**A**: Use the `find` command first to locate the person, then use the exact name shown in the results for delete or edit operations.

**Q**: Can I book multiple appointments for the same person at different times?<br>
**A**: Yes, you can book multiple appointments for the same person as long as they are at different times. The system prevents double booking at the same time.

**Q**: How do I backup my data?<br>
**A**: Simply copy the `addressbook.json` file from the `data` folder in your FirstImpressions directory. Store this backup in a safe location.

**Q**: What should I do if the application crashes or won't start?<br>
**A**: First, ensure Java 17+ is properly installed. If the problem persists, try deleting the `preferences.json` file and restarting the application. If data corruption is suspected, restore from a backup of your `addressbook.json` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
